   <p>My favorite beverage would have to be the Monster energy drink. I have had an energy drink
    probably every day since I was 16, when I started college. I used to drink Rockstar Sugar Free, 
    but after about 8 years, it started tasting funny and I felt like it was causing 
    issues with my health. So I quit for a year and was miserable without caffiene, so I switched
    to Monster. Monster has a cleaner taste, more flavor options and generally a better variety of 
    sugar free types. Cannot have all that sugar with ADHD. When Monster is not an available option, I 
    usually have to resort to other types and can tell the difference. The taste is not the cleanest (more chemical
    or bitter), they generally don't provide a sufficient caffiene amount and most of the time are more
    expensive.
